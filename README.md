# Aquila

ChatTriggers module for Hypixel Skyblock. I'll be adding stuff here along the way. Most of them are just QOL features.

Name inspired from AQN :tf: (not affiliated or anything, just for fun)

## Installation
You need ChatTriggers to run this module. Get it at https://www.chattriggers.com/
1. Download the .zip file from the [latest release](https://github.com/cd043136/Aquila/releases/tag/Latest)
2. In Minecraft, type `/ct files` which opens the ChatTriggers folder:

3. Head to the `modules` folder
4. Open the downloaded zip file and drag the `Aquila` folder into the modules folder

5. Run `/ct load`
6. Open settings with `/aq`

## Updates
### Method 1:
- To update, save a copy of your config and data files (located at `Aquila/config.toml` and `Aquila/data/data.json` respectively) somewhere
- Delete the `Aquila` folder in the modules folder (or `/ct delete Aquila`)
- Download the latest release and follow the installation steps above
- Before opening Minecraft, copy your config and data files back into the `Aquila` folder at their respective locations

### Method 2:
Alternatively, open the zip of the updated release and drag the `Aquila` folder into the modules folder, replacing the old one. This will not delete your config and data files. It may cause some issues (very unlikely) however.
